# Battle Cats Save File Editor

I have a discord server:https://discord.gg/DvmMgvn5ZB, it's the best way report bugs and you can leave your suggestions for new features to be implemented in the editor<br>
If you want to support my work and keep me motivated to continue to work on this project then maybe consider gifting me some ko-fi here:https://ko-fi.com/fieryhenry

## Thanks to:
Lethal's editor for giving me inspiration to start the project and it helped me work out how to patch the save data and edit cf/xp: https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleCatsCheats/comments/djehhn/editoren/

Beeven and csehydrogen's open source code, which helped me figure out how to patch save data: https://github.com/beeven/battlecats, https://github.com/csehydrogen/BattleCatsHacker

# How to use
## Warning: <b>Before editing anything, please make sure to create a backup of the save file somewhere, in case things go wrong</b>

This got way more complicated due to added security to the transfer system, you now need to have a rooted device - either emulator or real and extract the save that way. 

Download the tool https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor/releases (get Battle Cats Save File Editor.zip, not the exe)

I have created an updated tutorial video that goes you through the steps of getting the save from the game, editing it, putting it back in, and fixing save data is used elsewhere bug: https://youtu.be/D6hPnJTlq-U
